# Security Fixes Summary

## Overview
All security issues identified in the database audit have been successfully resolved.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Unindexed Foreign Keys (Performance & Security) ✅
Added indexes to improve query performance on foreign key columns:
- `fence_lines.survey_id` → `idx_fence_lines_survey_id`
- `images.uploaded_by` → `idx_images_uploaded_by`
- `quotes.user_id` → `idx_quotes_user_id`
- `site_content.updated_by` → `idx_site_content_updated_by`
- `survey_photos.survey_id` → `idx_survey_photos_survey_id`
- `user_invitations.invited_by` → `idx_user_invitations_invited_by`
- `user_roles.created_by` → `idx_user_roles_created_by`

**Impact**: Foreign key lookups are now optimized, preventing suboptimal query performance.

### 2. Unused Indexes (Performance Optimization) ✅
Removed unused indexes to reduce database overhead:
- `testimonials_is_active_idx`
- `faq_items_is_active_idx`
- `idx_guide_articles_category`
- `idx_guide_articles_published`
- `idx_guide_articles_featured`
- `idx_guide_articles_slug`

**Impact**: Reduced storage overhead and improved write performance.

### 3. Multiple Permissive Policies (Security) ✅
Fixed duplicate RLS policy on `guide_articles` table:
- Removed: "Authenticated users can view all guide articles"
- Kept: "Public can view published guide articles" (more permissive)

**Impact**: Eliminated potential policy conflicts and clarified access rules.

### 4. Function Search Path Mutable (Security) ✅
Secured `update_guide_articles_updated_at()` function:
- Added `SET search_path = public` to prevent search path hijacking
- Function is now marked as `SECURITY DEFINER` with stable search path

**Impact**: Protected against potential SQL injection via search path manipulation.

### 5. Leaked Password Protection (Manual Action Required) ⚠️

**Status**: Migration created with instructions

**Action Required**: Enable in Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to: **Authentication → Settings**
3. Scroll to the **"Security and Protection"** section
4. Enable **"Check for compromised passwords"**

**What it does**: Checks new passwords against HaveIBeenPwned database to prevent use of compromised passwords.

**Benefits**:
- Prevents use of passwords found in data breaches
- Enhances overall account security
- No performance impact (async check)
- Free to use via HaveIBeenPwned API

## Migration Details

**File**: `supabase/migrations/20251030000001_fix_security_issues_comprehensive.sql`

**Applied**: ✅ Successfully

## Verification Results

All changes have been verified:
- ✅ All 7 foreign key indexes created
- ✅ All 6 unused indexes removed
- ✅ Duplicate policy removed
- ✅ Function search path secured
- ⚠️ Leaked password protection pending manual enablement

## Build Status

✅ Project builds successfully with no errors

## Next Steps

1. **Enable Leaked Password Protection** in Supabase Dashboard (see instructions above)
2. Monitor query performance to confirm index improvements
3. Consider periodic security audits to catch future issues

## Database Performance Impact

- **Improved**: Query performance on foreign key joins
- **Reduced**: Database storage overhead from unused indexes
- **Enhanced**: Security posture with fixed RLS policies and function search paths
